# SNES2CDi Controller Adapter
Original Project & Instructions: https://github.com/anarterb/SNEStoCDi

This PCB allows users to create their own controller adapter by soldering components to one location. Using an SNES controller port and an Arduino Nano, you can choose to make a MiniDIN or a PigTail version. This is still a work in progress and has not been tested. Please follow the wiring and install instructions within the original projects GitHub.

3D printed housing will also be added to this GitHub in the future.

# FragolTech Specific Instructions
Custom code for this adapter PCB is available in the Arduino Code folder above. Load the sketch and the SNESPad library into the Arduino IDE and flash it to your Nano or Nano clone. This adapter should work without further configuration, just plug and play!
