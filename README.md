# SNES2CDi Controller Adapter
Original Project & Instructions: https://github.com/anarterb/SNEStoCDi

This PCB allows users to create their own controller adapter by soldering components to one location. Using an SNES controller port and an Arduino Nano, you can choose to make a MiniDIN or a PigTail version. This is still a work in progress and has not been tested. Please follow the wiring and install instructions within the original projects GitHub.

3D printed housing will also be added to this GitHub in the future.
