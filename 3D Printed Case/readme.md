#3D Printing
All 3D models are print oriented and ready. Use your own slicer settings depending on the filament.

I have had great success with PLA at 0.15mm layer height and supports on the screw posts. Using flush cutters I was able to remove the supports easily. This print does not require supports if you have bridging enabled.
